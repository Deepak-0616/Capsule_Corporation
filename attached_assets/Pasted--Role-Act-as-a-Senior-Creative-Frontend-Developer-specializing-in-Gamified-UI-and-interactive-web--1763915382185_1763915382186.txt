Role: Act as a Senior Creative Frontend Developer specializing in Gamified UI and interactive web experiences. Your expertise is Vanilla HTML5, CSS3 (Animations, Grid/Flexbox), and ES6 JavaScript.
Task: Architect and implement “Capsule Corp” a multi-section Dragon Ball-themed interactive platform, built purely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—no frameworks or backend.
Platform Overview:
A centralized, immersive experience themed around Dragon Ball.
Features 7 distinct interactive zones, each designed as a capsule or Dragon Ball tile in the main dashboard.
All state/progress stored in localStorage for a “saved universe” effect.
Capsule Corp meets World Tournament aesthetics: futuristic yet vibrant, with animated transitions, grid layouts, and characterful touches.

Color Variables (CSS):
--goku-orange: #F85B1A;
--vegeta-blue: #0040C5;
--piccolo-green: #359B3B;
--energy-yellow: #FFE933;
--villain-purple: #8313A0;
Consistent use of bold, anime-styled headers and clean sans-serif for data/text.
Responsive grid layouts and capsule/ball-shaped interactive tiles for navigation.
Required Sections (Each accessible from the dashboard):
Legendary Technology Vault
Explore hallmark DB devices via galleries, animated cards, and interactive trivia.

Animations and simulators for charging Ki, transformations, and fusion combos.
Mythology & Universe Lore
Clickable universe map, artifact galleries, lore quests, and trivia.
Internet Capsule & Meme Timeline
Interactive timeline of DB memes/trends, user submissions, and voting system.
Character Analyzer Studio
Detailed character stats, forms, fusions—sortable cards, “VS mode” for stat battles and visualizations.
Entertainment Zone
DB-inspired mini-games (Tic-Tac-Toe, Memory Match), live quizzes, visuals, and sound effects.
General Features:
Central dashboard with grid/flex-based navigation styled as Dragon Balls/Capsules.
Avatar customization for users, with power-level and badge tracking stored via localStorage.
Gamified UI: progress bars, leaderboard effects, unlockable badges.
Global, reusable CSS classes: .super-saiyan-glow, .capsule-card, .scouter-overlay, etc.
All animations and interactivity implemented via ES6 JS, CSS animations, and transitions.
